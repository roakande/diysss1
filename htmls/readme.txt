The .html files in this folder are for program that expects the
<link> and <script> to be formated as follows


<link rel="shortcut icon" href="/wole2/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
<link rel="icon" href="/wole2/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
<link href="/wole2/login_pc.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" >
<script src="/wole2/login_pc.js" type="text/javascript" ></script>

The exact path where the .js, .css and .ico are MUST be specified as shown

In /wole3, I will consider files that have their exact paths replaced with a '.'
